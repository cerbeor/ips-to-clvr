# 🌍 IPS to CLVR Prototype

A Java-based prototype for translating a **FHIR International Patient Summary (IPS)** into the new **European CLVR (Clinical Linkage and Vaccination Record)** QR Code specification.

This project is designed to be utilized as a dependency within the **AIRA NIST IIS Sandbox** environment to demonstrate the conversion and utilization of patient data from a standardized FHIR document into a compact, interoperable European format suitable for QR code deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The core purpose of the `IPS-to-CLVR` library is to act as a **data bridge**. It consumes a FHIR R4 IPS document (usually a `Bundle` or `Composition` resource) and maps the relevant clinical information—such as immunizations, allergies, and patient demographics—to the specific, highly constrained data elements defined by the CLVR specification.

### Key Capabilities

* **FHIR IPS Ingestion:** Parses and validates input against the FHIR IPS Implementation Guide.
* **CLVR Mapping:** Translates structured FHIR data elements (e.g., `Immunization`, `AllergyIntolerance`) into the corresponding CLVR data fields.
* **CLVR Payload Generation:** Creates the final, compact byte-string payload conforming to the European CLVR QR Code specification.
* **QR Code Generation:** Encodes the final CLVR payload into a standardized **QR Code** for physical or digital presentation.
* **Generate Sample Vaccine Certificate with CLVR:** Produces a demonstration certificate document containing the QR code and human-readable CLVR data.
